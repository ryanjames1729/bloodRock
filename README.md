This single page app is for my upcoming 100 mile race on 12/9/2017. Someone following a runner's progress can click on an aid station and get predicted times for the remaining aid stations and the finish. There are two different prediction times: one for a runner that runs even splits at constant pace and one for a runner that will run positive splits for the remainder of the race.
